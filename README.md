#  Damon 0603 🐳

Hi, nice to have you here. Who am I? I am a developer in Asset Management with experience in Statistical & Scientific Computing using Python / R. My goal is to build expertise as a full stack developer and create Data Science focused apps from scratch. To keep up with my enthusiasm, I am studying Artificial Intelligence with a major in Machine Learning at the Johannes Keppler University Linz.
